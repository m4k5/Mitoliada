Info
-------------------------
Yeah, this code actually executes properly, but it is so dramatically bad (I wrote it when I was 12) that I don't recommend anyone using or copying it. Really, don't do it for your good.
It is only an example how I started and how you **must not** write code.

*But finally it worked great, I got a six from Polish for it :)*

How does it work?
-------------------------
It uses Raspberry Pi with connected physical buttons and a Python library for GPIO, RPi socket for connecting things.
